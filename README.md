# How-to-Encode-and-Decode-Morse-Code-with-PHP
Morse code is a system of encoding letters, numbers, and punctuation using sequences of dots and dashes (or short and long signals). Implementing Morse code in PHP can be done through custom functions to convert text to Morse code and vice versa.
To run this PHP code, you'll need a PHP environment on your local machine or a web server. Below are the step-by-step instructions to run the Morse code program in a command-line environment.

# Step 1: Install PHP (if not already installed)
Windows: Download and install PHP from php.net. Make sure to add PHP to your system's PATH.
Linux/Mac: PHP is usually pre-installed. You can check by typing php -v in the terminal. If not installed, you can install it via a package manager:
For Linux: sudo apt install php (for Ubuntu/Debian)
For macOS: brew install php (Homebrew)
# Step 2: Save the PHP Code
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text).
Copy and paste the provided PHP code into the editor.
Save the file with a .php extension, e.g., morse_code.php.
# Step 3: Open Command Line or Terminal
Navigate to the directory where you saved the PHP file.
Windows: Use cd path\to\your\php\file (e.g., cd C:\projects\morse)
Linux/Mac: Use cd /path/to/your/php/file (e.g., cd ~/projects/morse)
# Step 4: Run the PHP Script
In the terminal/command prompt, type:
bash
Copy code
php morse_code.php
This will run the script in the command-line interface.
# Step 5: Provide Input
The script will prompt you to enter text or Morse code.
For Encoding Text to Morse:
Type a text string, e.g., HELLO, and hit Enter.
The script will output the Morse code translation.
For Decoding Morse to Text:
Enter Morse code, e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. --- (for "HELLO"), and hit Enter.
The script will decode it back to plain text.
